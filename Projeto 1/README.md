## Description
The goal of this assignment is to develop a Haskell program to set appropriate data types to model a country roadmap as a graph of interconnected cities (nodes) by roads (edges), and to define functions to properly manipulate it and to calculate some metrics such as the shortest path between two cities, and solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for the given roadmap.
